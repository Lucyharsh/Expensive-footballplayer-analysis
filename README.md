# Football Player Market Value & Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on professional football players to uncover how age, performance, and position influence market value and goal-scoring ability.

## Key Findings
- Player market value rises rapidly between ages 18–23, representing the development-to-peak transition phase
- Match participation peaks between ages 24–28, reflecting a player's physical prime
- Goal scoring peaks around ages 23–27, aligning with athletic and tactical maturity
- A positive relationship exists between goals scored and market value, confirming elite attackers command higher transfer fees
- The top 10 goal scorers are dominated by forwards, showing scoring ability is concentrated among high performers
- A notable value spike at age 31 highlights the presence of a few elite superstars who retain exceptional worth later in their careers
